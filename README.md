## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of DevSecOps principles by incorporating security measures throughout the development and deployment processes. It includes a sample Python web application, infrastructure as code configurations, and CI/CD pipelines with integrated security checks.

## Features

- **Python Web Application**: A Flask-based web app demonstrating secure coding practices.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Kubernetes configurations for deploying the application.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying the application with security scans.
